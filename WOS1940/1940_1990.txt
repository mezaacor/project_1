ID ECONOMETRIC MODELS; PARAMETRIC MODELING; EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING; MOVING AVERAGE; AUTOREGRESSIVE PROCESSES
AB The purpose of this paper is to use a recent development in statisical theory known as parametric modeling to forecast wheat yields in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Argentina. The essence of this approach is that the data are used for identifying and estimating random components in the form of moving average and autoregressive processes. It does not identify and measure structural relationships as is attempted when forecasting with econometric models. Exponential smoothing is also used to forecast yields in the United States and Canada. The Thiel coefficient is then computed to determine the forecasting accuracy of parametric modeling compared with exponential smoothing.

AB In this paper, forecasting models are constructed for the monthly inward and outward station movements of the Wisconsin Telephone Company using an iterative procedure developed by Box and Jenkins. Data covering the period January 1951 through October 1966 were used to develop the model. Forecasts with 95-percent probability limits were calculated for three years from November 1966, and were compared with the actual observations. The properties of the models are discussed in detail. Alternative models for forecasting are also entertained and compared with those chosen.

ID POLLUTANT CONCENTRATIONS; SMOG EFFECT; REGRESSION
AB A time series analysis of air monitoring data for the downtown Los Angeles station has been used to forecast pollutant concentrations. Trends are thereby detectable. Hydrocarbon, total oxidant, and carbon monoxide are trending downward. Nitric oxide is trending upward. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are behaving in a complex manner, and no forecast is possible at this time. These statements are based on analysis of the data to the end of 1969. Somewhat different results were obtained using the data to the end of 1967. This emphasizes the empirical, adaptive nature of the time series forecasting and the need for updating. A smog effect diagram was derived from the air monitoring results. From the regression equation and the standard deviations, mutually interconsistent air quality standards have been derived. A set of these is oxidant: 10 pphm; nitrogen oxides: 25 pphm; and nonmethane hydrocarbon 0.6 ppm C. If current trends persist, this work indicates the control program is having an effect in the anticipated direction. Emission standards appear to be consistent with the air quality standards on the basis of the analysis for this station. Data from other stations and other locales could also be productively analyzed by the methods used here.

These models are capable of representing both stationary and nonstationary series and can be easily generalized to allow for seasonality and to accommodate a leading indicator. In addition a model building strategy is discussed and the problem of forecasting is considered. Finally, the methodology is illustrated with several examples.

proper level of working capital, forecasts of sales levels, collections on receivables, inventory lead times, etc., must be considered. Other examples of variables used for forecasting financial data are well known and innumerable.

AB Time series analysis techniques are used to model and to forecast populations. An autoregressive (AR) and a moving average (MA) model, which seem to fit the population of Sweden very well, are found. Forecasts are calculated using both models and are compared with the forecasts obtained by other methods. This comparison is very favorable for the time series models. Although our study is confined to the mid-year population of Sweden, there are good reasons to expect that the technique can be successfully applied to other population parameters.

Forecasting performances of three methods—Box‐Jenkins, Holt‐Winters and stepwise autoregression—are compared over a large sample of economic time series. The possibility of combining individual forecasts in the production of an overall forecast is explored, and we present empirical results which indicate that such a procedure can frequently be profitable.

AB The purpose of this study is to forecast the market shares of alternative home-heating units: oil-burners, gas-burners and electric-heating units for the United States. The forecasting method used is The Markov Process with estimated transition probability matrices. The transition probabilities represent whether households will continue to use the same heating unit which they have used in the recent past or switch to another type unit. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation techniques have been used to estimate these transition probabilities from aggregate historical market shares of alternative home-heating units.

ID EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING; ARMA; NONLINEAR LEAST-SQUARES; BOX-JENKINS
AB Using an exponential smoothing procedure and an autoregressive-moving average process; forecasts for the monthly Palmer Drought Severity Index were calculated. The autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions of severity index values were used as a starting point for the autoregressive-moving average model selection process. Of the many possible autoregressive-moving average models, the one that was selected provided the best forecasts based on the mean square error. Monthly data for the period 1929–1969 were utilized in a nonlinear least-squares computer routine to arrive at estimated parameter values for the autoregressive-moving average model. Monthly forecasts with a lead time of one month were generated using the exponential smoothing and autoregressive-moving average procedures for the period 1970–1972. These forecasts were compared with the myopic (persistence) forecasts, Xt+1=Xt. The mean square errors of the forecasts were 0.63 for the autoregressive-moving average model, 0.65 for the myopic model, and 0.79 for the exponential smoothing model. From the mean-square-error calculations, it appears that there is no statistically significant difference between the forecasts given by the Box-Jenkins and myopic models; however, the 95% confidence intervals for these two models overlap only slightly during the first part of the forecast period indicating that there may be some advantage to using the Box-Jenkins model instead of the myopic model. Both of these models are superior to the exponential smoothing model. These results demonstrate the usefulness of the relatively new autoregressive-moving average time series analysis procedures.

LA English
DT Article
ID EXPONENTIAL POLYNOMIAL; TERMED EXPONOMIAL; VANDERMONDE MATRIX
AB This article is concerned with the problem of forecasting nonstationary time series when the data at hand are finite. One way to tackle this problem is to choose a deterministic linear model, however intuitive, and fit it to the data by generalized least squares. With some additional assumptions best linear unbiased predictors can be constructed. Here we do just that, in fitting an exponential polynomial, termed exponomial in [3], to a discrete nonstationary time series, and show how to construct optimal predictors. Exponomials are particularly appealing, as the best linear unbiased one-step predictors are constructed in a most straightforward manner. The extrapolation of infinite time series when the underlying model is an exponomial was first considered in [3] and later in [l]. Although we consider essentially the same problem, we shall be concerned mainly with statistical aspects given a finite nonstationary discrete time series. For the paper to be self-contained we first give a brief account of generalized least squares. Next we consider the prediction problem followed by two important special cases. We also suggest a problem concerning the generalized Vandermonde matrix.

AB Many annual time series in socioeconomic systems are steadily increasing functions of time. This paper deals with an empirical approach to analyzing and projecting such trending time series from models of relative growth rates or percent changes. A class of relative growth rate models is defined which includes the linear, exponential, modified exponential and logistic growth curves as special eases. Parameters are estimated for the most part by linear regression techniques since the, relative growth rates for this class of models are linear in the parameters. The ternd curve for each model is obtained by integration and approximate-confidence limits can be obtained for the forecasts of future series values.

An emphasis is given to looking at the raw data and keeping an open (but informed) mind when interpreting the correlation structure. The importance of the analyst not forgetting that he usually only forms a very small part of the overall policymaking machinery must be emphasized; and this cog has to remember that the onus is very much on him to mesh smoothly with the other organizational components if he wishes his work to be accepted and himself not rejected as a misfit by management. Practitioners have the need of avoiding being too proud (or shortsighted) to compromise; for statistical truth is neither absolute nor a fully convertible currency, and there are other gods that deserve (and will exact) recognition.

ID ADAPTIVE FILTER; BOX-JENKINS; ARMA
AB This paper extends the applicability of a heuristic filtering technique, adaptive filtering, by dealing with a number of practical considerations in time series forecasting. These are problems that have been raised by other researchers examining this technique and by practitioners using it for time series analysis. These modifications make adaptive filtering much more comparable to the Box-Jenkins methodology for autoregressive/moving average processes. A specific application of adaptive filtering is provided.

AB In  this paper, we first outline Box-Jenkins (B-J) notation and the stages in theirapproach to  time series analysis and forecasting, u e.  identification, estimation and diagnostic checking, and forecasting.  We then describe the associated statistical tools  used in  the choiceof  B-J  modeis and also  discuss seasonal B-J  models.  We  then go  on  to  deal  with  a spécifie economic time series, identifying and estimating variant B-J models accordingly. After choosinga  model for  forecasting purposes, we compare its forecasts  with those generated  by  an  econometrie model. Finally, we describe  extensions of  the B-J approach  such as "transfer  junctionmodelling"  and  multivariate analysis, and  discuss  the  recently proposed  method  of  "intervention analysis" utilizing the B-J approach.

ID DEMAND; ENERGY; BOX-JENKINS-ECONOMETRIC; WEATHER
AB Estimates of peak demand requirements in the future constitute the foundation for planning in the electrical energy industry. Because of the critical nature of accurate forecasts, forecasting methodology is continually being refined. In this paper a further refinement is made by using a combined Box-Jenkins/econometric approach to forecast monthly peak system load for a specific utility. By taking account of changes in economic and weather related variables in a Box-Jenkins time series model, improved forecasts are obtained.

AB This paper endeavors to develop a forecasting model for discrete approximations to the load duration curve using Box-Jenkins time series analysis. A model is structured and estimated for six, twenty. and fifty discrete approximations for two electric utility regions in the United States. The forecast results are extremely good. indicating that while a larger number of approximations performs marginally better, there is nothing to mitigate using only a six-step approximation.

AB The methodology of projections or predictions has clearly become a separate area; it continues to grow and change at a rather rapid pace, as the number of books and articles published on the subject increases and experiences are accumulated on the application of methods. As with any new domain, there are considerable disagreements about what is considered important, useful, applicable; different schools of thought advocate their personal approach and try to bring their own way of thinking the whole field. It may be many years before things have stabilized. Currently, there is very little solid evidence to objectively establish even the most basic aspects of prediction. What remains is the favorable opinion and faith - very often excessively colored by personal deformations - inclinations towards a certain school of thought, and opinions a priori. The only certainty is perhaps that there is no unanimity of opinion, neither on the best approach, nor on the aspects that would be the most important, nor on which method would be most appropriate, would be the most precise, or the least expensive, or the least complex for specific applications. While no consensus can ever be expected, at least some degree of agreement should be achievable among experts before expensive, or least complex methods for specific applications. Even if no consensus can ever be projection can reach their fullness for effective applications. The present article expresses the views of the author, as to the aspects which he considers important in terms of projection, the difficulties and problems which arise in this field, and finally the type of discussion necessary to make the projection more useful and adapted to the end user who must predict the future.

ID COST; ARIMA; DEMAND
AB Our objective is to present a methodology which minimizes the expected cost of predictive errors when: (a) predictions are obtained for the product of two separately attained but contemporaneous time series, and (b) a linear asymmetric error cost function reflects the costs associated with predictive errors. Integrated Autoregressive-Moving Average models characterize the two series. Each prediction is expressed as a quantile of the conditional distribution of the contemporaneous product of the two series (i.e., a quantile of the distribution of the product of two Gaussian random variables with nonzero means). An actually observed hospital food service demand problem exemplifies the procedure and utility of our methodology.

AB The majority of seasonal adjustment methods, officially adapted by government statistical agencies, belong to the category of techniques based on linear smoothing filters, usually known as moving averages of length 2m+ 1, say. These methods have often been criticized because they lack an explicit model concerning the decomposition of the original series and because their estimates, for observations in the most recent years, do not have the same degree of reliability as those of central observations.

TI FORECASTING STATE RETAIL SALES - ECONOMETRIC VS TIME-SERIES MODELS
SO ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL PREDICTOR; ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIC; IMPORTANT INDICATOR; EVALUATION PERIOD; TIME SERIES MODEL 
AB The volume of retail sales is an important indicator of state economic activity and forms the base of the percentage sales tax. Accurate forecasting of the variable is of interest to fiscal authorities and private analysts as well. This paper compares the performance of two techniques in forecasting net taxable retail sales: the ARIMA time series model and a structural model which is representative of the econometric approach. Four measures of forecast accuracy are calculated and the relative merits of the techniques are discussed. The ARIMA model was found to perform better than the structural model during the evaluation period used in the analysis. However, it is also shown that a predictor formed from combining the ARIMA and structural model predictors may be superior to exclusive use of the ARIMA.

TI TIME-SERIES FORECASTS OF CHATTER STABILITY LIMITS .1. ESTABLISHMENT OF

DT Article
ID SIGNALS; FPE; YULE-WALKER'S; AUTOREGRESSIVE
AB This paper deals with the foundational method of forecasting chatter stability limits with acceleration signals in cutting process by applying time series analysis and forecasting theory. In this study machine tools and cutting process are considered as a black-box and consequently all the factors concerned with chatter are included in the analysis, hence the method proposed in this study is very actual and practical for forecasting chatter stability limits. Firstly it is verified theoretically that chatter stability limits can be predicted from the trend of the acceleration amplitude and next taking variance of sampled data zt is shown to be effective as a method of converting trends of amplitude to those of average level. After the estimation of the time series models for the preprocessed series using the FPE method and Yule-Walker's equation, future values are forecasted precisely by means of the models estimated. As for the prediction of the onset of chatter vibration, three methods of model estimation for each cutting speed and forecast origin viz. (1) using common model, (2) using the same set of model order (p, d) and estimating autoregressive parameters, (3) estimating the new suitable model, are investigated and the three methods are all shown to be capable of forecasting practical limit conditions of chatter applying the acceleration level on the onset of chatter vibration at a cutting speed.

DT Article
ID FORECAST ERROR; ARMA MODEL; WHITE NOISE PROCESS; 
   TRANSFER FUNCTION MODEL; TOTAL BIRTH 
AB The relationship between classical demographic deterministic forecasting models, stochastic structural econometric models and time series models is discussed. Final equation autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models for Australian total live-births are constructed. Particular attention is given to the problem of transforming the time series to stationarity (and Gaussianity) and the properties of the forecasts are analyzed. Final form transfer function models linking births to females in the reproductive age groups are also constructed and a comparison of actual forecast performance using the various models is made. Long-run future forecasts are generated and compared with available projections based on the deterministic cohort model after which some policy implications of the analysis are considered.

ID ECONOMIC; ARIMA; DISCRETE LINEAR
AB Time series analysis methods have been applied to a large number of practical problems, including modeling and forecasting economic time series and process and quality control. One aspect of time series analysis is the use of discrete linear transfer functions to model the interrelationships between input and output time series. This paper is an introduction to the identification, estimation, and diagnostic checking of these models. Some aspects of forecasting with transfer function models are also discussed. A survey of intervention analysis models in which the input series is an indicator variable corresponding to an isolated event thought to influence the output is also given. Familiarity with univariate autoregressive integrated moving average modeling is assumed. Extensions to more general multiple time series analysis methods are also briefly discussed.

predicting of annual earnings per share. Various refinements were made of previously used methodologies. The results of the multivariate analysis 
indicated that financial analysts provide the most accurate forecasts. In addition, the divergence in accuracy between the various sources 
of forecasts tend to decrease as the end of the year approaches, while at the same time there is a general increase in accuracy. Also specific 
results are provided for individual model performance.

We first disciss the case where Zt follows a stationary multiple moving average process and propose a measure of the efficiency of aggregation. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for the case of no gain by employing the component series. Extension of the results to stationary multiple autoregressive process and some non-stationarity processes is discussed, and an illustrative example is given.

TI ESTIMATION AND FORECAST PERFORMANCE OF A MULTIVARIATE TIME-SERIES MODEL
   OF SALES
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTIVARIATE; SURARMA; SALES; 
   econometric models; exogenous variables 
AB A unique form of a multivariate time series model—a “seemingly unrelated autoregressive moving average” model (SURARMA)—is developed in the context of forecasting unit sales of a product in four states. Data from an anonymous firm are used to test the appropriateness of the model and are found to conform to the model's constraints. The model provides substantial improvement in parameter estimation efficiency and forecast performance in comparison with individual state univariate models. SURARMA is potentially relevant to many market forecasting problems involving multiple constituent time series subunits such as states, regions, or products from a product line. Models of marketing processes which make use of time series data have been studied extensively (Bass and Parsons 1969; Beckwith 1972; Clarke 1973; Geurts and Ibrahim 1975; Helmer and Johansson 1977). For example, traditional structural econometric models (Wildt 1974) have been used to measure the effects of decision variables and to formulate normative marketing policies. Univariate time series models (Naylor, Seaks, and Wichern 1972; Newbold and Granger 1974) have produced good forecasts even though these models do not incorporate the effects of exogenous variables. Time series models and structural econometric models need not be viewed as fundamentally different although they appear to be perceived as such by some marketing researchers. Recent work (Leone 1979), following a general linear model outlined by Granger and Newbold (1977), combines the ideas and techniques of univariate time series analysis with those of structural econometric analysis. This work provides important insights about relations between variables and aids the determination of optimal marketing strategies (Leone 1979). Thus, if the purpose of constructing a marketing model is to address a policy issue, combining structural and time series analysis may provide benefits in excess of costs. If the purpose of constructing a marketing model is forecasting, however, the combining of time series analysis with structural econometric analysis may not always be cost-benefit efficient. For example, Leone (1979) states (p. 7): It is generally accepted … that when the goal is forecasting the time-series approach outperforms the econometric model in most cases (even with only univariate models) and is more parsimonious. If these ideas are correct, a firm whose univariate time series models produce less accurate forecasts than are desired cannot generally expect to improve forecast accuracy by building a structural model. In such cases forecast accuracy may be improved by the multivariate analysis of several related individual sales series. The purpose of our article is to demonstrate the improvement in forecast accuracy that can result from such a joint analysis of several individual series. We apply a special case of the general multivariate autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model to the unit sales data of an anonymous firm. The model is labeled SURARMA (“seemingly unrelated” ARMA) and our application involves some of the pioneering estimation procedures of Nelson (1976).1 The joint analysis of “seemingly unrelated” time series will produce more efficient parameter estimates and better forecasts than individual analysis whenever the residuals from the individual series are contemporaneously correlated. The contemporaneous correlation information used in the SURARMA estimation procedure is information which summarizes the effect of common exogenous shocks on all the series being considered in the analysis. Thus, the SURARMA technique seems to be applicable to many marketing situations because of the frequent interest in several different series that are related through common external influences. Examples of such marketing series include unit sales of a product in different sales territories and the sales of different but related products in a single territory.

ID BOX-JENKINS; TRANSFORMATION; ANALYZING STATIONARY; ARMA
AB The Box-Jenkins approach to time series analysis, which is an efficient way of analyzing stationary time series, recommends differencing as a general method for transforming a nonstationary time series into a stationary one. This paper gives a methodological discussion of some other ways of transforming a nonstationary series, in particular removing linear trends. It is argued that in many cases removing trends is superior to differencing in several respects. For example, when the process generating the time series is an ARMA(p,q) process added to a linear trend, differencing will produce an ARMA(p,q + 1) process that violates the invertibility conditions and is therefore difficult to estimate. The discussion is extended to time series with seasonal patterns.

A data set containing monthly volumes on a freeway segment for the years 1968 through 1976 is used to fit a time series model. The resulting model is used to forecast volumes for the year 1977. The forecast volumes are then compared to actual volumes in 1977. The results of this study indicate that time series techniques can be used to develop highly accurate and inexpensive short term forecasts. A discussion of the ways in which such models can be used to evaluate the effects of policy changes or other outside impacts is included.

TI MODELING AND FORECASTING SALES DATA BY TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SALES; STOCHASTIC; ARMA; DETERMINISTIC; MARKETING STRATEGY 
AB Time series modeling technique is used to model a series of sales data in which seasonality causes distinct spike peaks. The analysis of actual sales data shows that the seasonality in the data can be approximated by a deterministic function and the stochastic component is a sixth-order autoregressive moving average model. Use of the combined deterministic and stochastic models to derive the minimum mean squared forecast yields reliable results. Obtaining accurate sales forecasts for the selection of proper marketing strategy is a problem of growing concern. Most of the prevailing forecasting methods make use of static techniques like regression and correlation analysis (Pindyck and Rubenfeld 1976). These techniques ignore the dynamics or memory of the process involved and treat the data, which are mostly in the form of time series, as being independent. Serial or autocorrelation, generally present in such data, then distorts the analysis, masking the true nature of the interrelationships and inflating the forecast errors. A popular technique which does not require the assumption of independent data is exponential smoothing (Brown 1962). However, it is an ad hoc technique and involves the problem of selecting, often arbitrarily, an appropriate weight factor. Time series analysis provides an ideal solution to the problem of serially correlated data. Some work in marketing research using time series analysis has been reported recently (Helmer and Johansson 1977; Mabert and Radcliffe 1974; Moriarty and Adams 1979; Tiao and Pack 1975). The advantage of time series modeling over other econometric methods of obtaining forecasts has been demonstrated by Geurts and Ibrahim (1975). Most recent work in time series modeling has followed the Box-Jenkins (1970) method whereby seasonality in data is accounted for by using a stochastic difference operator of the form (1 - Bs). However, the use of this operator may be ineffective or even inappropriate in certain situations (Wu 1977), especially those cases in which the seasonality in the data is not homogeneous. The purpose of our article is to illustrate the use of an alternative modeling approach to time series analysis in an actual business situation wherein the nonstochastic structure in the data is captured by the use of deterministic functions. The alternative approach is different from the Box-Jenkins method both in model philosophy and in modeling strategy (Wu 1977). The time series data on the sale of a particular line of consumer products are analyzed. A brief overview of the alternative modeling procedure for the nonstationary time series is given first; the application of the technique in forecasting product demand is then described and discussed.

AB Methods of time series forecasting are proposed which can be applied automatically. However, they are not rote formulae, since they are based on a flexible philosophy which can provide several models for consideration. In addition it provides diverse diagnostics for qualitatively and quantitatively estimating how well one can forecast a series. The models considered are called ARARMA models (or ARAR models) because the model fitted to a long memory time series (t) is based on sophisticated time series analysis of AR (or ARMA) schemes (short memory models) fitted to residuals Y(t) obtained by parsimonious‘best lag’non‐stationary autoregression. Both long range and short range forecasts are provided by an ARARMA model Section 1 explains the philosophy of our approach to time series model identification. Sections 2 and 3 attempt to relate our approach to some standard approaches to forecasting; exponential smoothing methods are developed from the point of view of prediction theory (section 2) and extended (section 3). ARARMA models are introduced (section 4). Methods of ARARMA model fitting are outlined (sections 5,6). Since‘the proof of the pudding is in the eating’, the methods proposed are illustrated (section 7) using the classic example of international airline passengers.

AB In the last few decades many methods have become available for forecasting. As always, when alternatives exist, choices need to be made so that an appropriate forecasting method can be selected and used for the specific situation being considered. This paper reports the results of a forecasting competition that provides information to facilitate such choice. Seven experts in each of the 24 methods forecasted up to 1001 series for six up to eighteen time horizons. The results of the competition are presented in this paper whose purpose is to provide empirical evidence about differences found to exist among the various extrapolative (time series) methods used in the competition.

ID TIME SERIES ANALYSIS; ROBUST REGRESSION; TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEMAND
AB The method of ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalizations of it have been the mainstay of most forecasting methodologies for many years. It is well‐known, however, that outliers or unusual values can have a large influence on least‐squares estimators. Users of automatic forecasting packages, in particular, need to be aware of the influence that outlying data values can have on statistical analyses and forecasting results. Robust methods are available to modify least‐squares procedures so that outliers have much less influence on the final estimates; yet these formal methods have not found their way into general forecasting procedures. This paper provides a case study in which classical least‐square‐estimation procedures are complemented with a robust alternative to enhance statistical fit criteria and improve forecasting performance. The study suggests that much can be gained in understanding the nature of outliers and their influence on forecasting performance by performing a robust regression in addition to OLS.

AB Some levels of economic activity change over the days of the week. Also, the composition of the calendar changes over the years so that a particular month contains a different configuration of days of the week each year. The effects of the changing composition of the calendar upon a monthly time series is called trading day variation. This paper discusses one way to model trading day variation in monthly time series and how this model can be used to obtain improved forecasts over univariate ARIMA models. The ideas are illustrated on an actual data set.

ID ARMP; FPM; HYDROLOGICAL; 
   PATTERN ANALYSIS; TRAINING DATA
AB An autoregressive model with Markovian parameters (ARMP/a.r.m.p.) and a feature prediction scheme (FPM) are developed in this paper. The ARMP is physically based and adaptive in its implementation thus taking into consideration the inherent periodicities in hydrological time series. The FPM is motivated by the current inability to provide a suitable and sufficiently comprehensive yet simplified mathematical hydrological model. It is based on pattern analysis and is such that a system's dynamic feature is predicted using a priori data which can subsequently be used to simulate the missing data and forecast future hydrological parameters. The ARMP and FPM provide efficient alternatives to some other existing models which are not, in general, applicable to all classes of hydrological problems; with an added advantage of on-line forecasting. A comparative analysis of the techniques are undertaken using the discharge record data from the River Nile at Aswan Dam from 1870-1945. It is further proposed that in order to enhance the over-all performance of the prediction scheme, the FPM may be used as an input (training data) to the ARMP.

The role of the coefficients cn and dn (n ≥ 0) of φ and φ−1 respectivey, in prediction, filtering and control theory is well-kown. We show that the cn's and dn's can be obtained recursively in terms of the Fourier coefficients of log f. Also, recursive and updating formulae fr the kolmogorov wiener predictor similar to those Box-Jenkins are provided.

ID TIME SERIES; HOUSING STARTS; SALES; ECONOMIC
AB Using techniques rooted in modem time series theory, a model is formulated to generate short-run, unconditional forecasts of new, single-family housing starts and sales. The model also generates forecasts of seven other economic variables thought to be important determinants of starts and sales. After estimating the model over a sample period, ex post forecasts are produced and compared with realized values. The main conclusion drawn is that the model seems to perform reasonably well for the first six months beyond the sample.

AB The major part of this paper will be devoted to a discussion of the forecasting of time series through the fitting to historical data of autoregressive integrated moving average models. We will consider the use of such models both for the analysis of a single time series, and the exploitation of relationships among series, in the production of superior forecasts. However, before specializing our discussion to these models, we consider the broader issue of the general approach to forecasting problems embodied in time series model building, and in the perspective of the time series analyst.

ID INTERVENTIONS; TIME SERIES; DISCONTINUOUS PROCESSES
AB Commonly used forecasting methods often produce meaningless forecasts when time series display abrupt changes in level. Measuring and accounting for the effect of discontinuities can have a significant impact on forecasting accuracy. In addition, if discontinuities are considered non‐random and their cause is known, then adjustments can be made to more reliably represent the trend, seasonal and random component. This paper concerns a computational method used in forecasting inherently discontinuous time series. The method provides screening to determine the locations and types of discontinuities. The paper includes analyses of actual time series which are typical of certain types of inherently discontinuous processes.

AB This paper examines the relative forecasting performance of multivariate time‐series analysis. One hundred consecutive monthly observations for three accounting series were obtained from a manufacturing division of a large corporation. Regression, univariate time‐series, transfer‐function, and multiple time‐series models were identified, estimated, and used to forecast each accounting series. The multiple time‐series model yielded the smallest forecast variances.

TI FORECASTING WITH DIAGONAL MULTIPLE TIME-SERIES MODELS - AN EXTENSION OF
   UNIVARIATE MODELS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTIPLE TIME SERIES MODELS; ARMA, SURARMA
AB The authors discuss a special case of multiple time series models in which the autoregressive and moving average parameter matrices are diagonal. These models, called MTS-D, are appropriate if the random shocks which drive the series are only contemporaneously correlated. The flexibility and usefulness of this approach are illustrated in the context of a competitive market situation with five sales series, where individual components follow different univariate time series models. Theoretical as well as empirical justifications for expecting more precise parameter estimates are given. Forecasts from the model compare favorably with those from the univariate models. Increasing interest in building time series models to forecast sales is evident in the marketing literature (Geurts and Ibrahim 1975; Helmer and Johansson 1977; Moriarty and Adams 1979; Moriarty and Salamon 1980; Hanssens 1980; Bass and Pilon 1980; Leone 1980; Kapoor, Madhok, and Wu 1981). The success of univariate time series models has encouraged forecasters to extend this methodology and include other possibly related series in the model. For example, Helmer and Johansson (1977) use a transfer function modeling approach in which the sales are influenced unidirectionally by the amount spent on advertising. A feedback relationship between advertising and sales has been modeled by Aaker, Carman, and Jacobson (1982). Lately interest has focused on a special class of multivariate time series models, in which the errors ait in m ARMA time series models ϕi(B)zit = θi(B)ait (1 ≤ i ≤ m) are contemporaneously correlated. Those models are extensions of the seemingly unrelated multivariate regression models originally discussed by Zellner (1962). Nelson (1976) applied Zellner's approach to time series data and discussed the gains in efficiency from jointly estimating the paramters in the m time series models. In particular, he considered two contemporaneously correlated first order autoregressive models and derived the asymptotic variances of the joint estimates. He showed that these variances are never larger, and in most cases are smaller, than the variances of the parameter estimates derived separately. The gains in efficiency increase with the strength of the correlation among ait and ajt. Apart from this large-sample justification, Nelson applied the joint estimation approach to two contemporaneously correlated short-term interest rate series which individually followed first order autoregressive models. He found that the post-sample predictions were more accurate than those from the individually estimated univariate models. In the marketing literature, Moriarty and Salamon (1980) applied this seemingly unrelated estimation approach to a set of four sales series, each of which follows a multiplicative (0,1,1) × (0,1,1)s=13 model. Using a holdout period of 13 observations, they illustrate empirically that the joint estimation approach leads to an increase in the accuracy of the post-sample predictions. Until now, however, difficulties associated with the seemingly unrelated time series models have prevented a more widespread use of these techniques in applied forecasting: 1. The computation of the joint estimates of the autoregressive and moving average parameters in ϕ1(B)zit = θi(B)ait (1 ≤ i ≤ m) and of the elements in the covariance matrix Σ = {σij = Cov(ait,ajt)} is a problem of generalized least squares. Though in principle the computations pose no difficulties, in the past the application of this methodology has been made difficult by the fact that users had to develop their own computer software. The programs used by Moriarty and Salamon (1980), for example, were developed especially for the special multiplicative (0,1,1) × (0,1,1)s=13 model. 2. The seemingly unrelated ARMA time series models (or SURARMA models as they are called by Moriarty and Salamon) considered in the literature involve the assumption that all component series follow the same model. In many applications this assumption is restrictive, because in general the individual series will follow different models. We show that these difficulties can be overcome by treating diagonal cases of the general m-dimensional multiple time series model, henceforth referred to as MTS-D. Because general computer programs for estimating the parameters in multiple time series models have recently become available (Tiao et al. 1979), the joint estimation of parameters in MTS-D models poses no practical difficulties. Furthermore, in this approach the individual models for each component series need not be the same. This feature adds flexibility to the approach, because in many marketing applications the individual models will be different. No model is appropriate in every situation, and this is certainly also true for the diagonal multiple time series model. The MTS-D model is only appropriate if the errors at different time periods are uncorrelated (ρij(k) = corr(ait,ajt+k) = 0 for k ≠ 0, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m). If there are correlations at nonzero lags, a full multiple time series approach must be adopted. Furthermore, gains in estimation and forecast efficiencies from the MTS-D procedure can be expected only if the errors are contemporaneously correlated. If these correlations are weak, one should use the univariate time series modeling approach instead. The spirit of time series modeling is to let the data speak for themselves. Thus, it is very important to calculate the sample correlations rij(k) among the residuals from the univariate models, âit and âjt+k, and check whether the diagonal multiple time series approach is appropriate. This aspect of the analysis is emphasized in our article. We illustrate the diagonal multiple time series method on a set of five competitive sales series, wherein the individual components follow different ARIMA models. In the Appendix, we derive the asymptotic efficiency for the joint estimates from contemporaneously correlated (0,1,1) × (0,1,1)s models, which are exactly the ones used in the empirical analysis by Moriarty and Salamon (1980). We show that Nelson's (1976) approach generalizes very easily to seasonal models.

AB One way to forecast aggregate time series of categorical data is to estimate the transition matrix. Multiplying the present data vector by this matrix n times, one gets a forecast of the situation n periods ahead. It is well known that this method works, if the objects follow
independent and identically distributed Markov chains. It is shown that the proccesses need not to be markovian as long as they are time-homogeneous. A new type of dependence is developed, which is independent of the ordering of the index set.

AB It has always been difficult to model the travel industry because tourism involves such a diverse set of activities. However, various regional decision makers have become increasingly interested in predicting the flows of visitors through their market. Accurate forecasts of the number of tourists' arrivals, their length of stay, and their expenditures improve planning and inventory control. Stochastic time-series models have compared favorably with econometric models at the aggregate level while some naive automatic forecasting tools have fared well in comparison when predicting industry-level behavior. Several approaches have been developed to improve forecast accuracy. This paper presents parsimonious methods of improving accuracy by combining various forecasting techniques. The Box-Jenkins stochastic time-series method is combined with a traditional econometric technique to forecast airline visitors to the State of Florida.

AB Some seasonal time series models are considered which are appropriate for the univariate modelling and forecasting of many time series. The equivalent ARIMA forms of these models provide the basis for a critical examination of the Box-Jenkins approach to seasonal model-building. It is concluded that this approach is unsatisfactory and in particular can often result in over-differencing and the adoption of an inappropriate model. Two main reasons for this are discussed: (a) the inadequate class of models considered which rests on a restricted view of parsimony, and (b) the shortcomings of the basic approach to model identification.

   CASE OF SOFTWOOD LUMBER IMPORTS

LA English
DT Article
ID INTERNATIONAL TRADE; TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; FORECASTING
AB An econometric model based on housing starts, prices, and past imports; a univariate time-series model using past imports only; and a bivariate time-series model of imports and housing starts were used to forecast United States softwood lumber imports. Experiments were performed to test the forecasting accuracy of each model assuming either perfect knowledge of the future value of determining variables, or complete ignorance. These experiments were repeated to forecast 1 month or 3 months ahead. The results suggested that the bivariate time-series model based on lumber imports and housing starts was the most useful from the point of view of pure forecasting. It was at least as accurate as the econometric model, both in 1-month and 3-month forecasts, and it required much less information. Under comparable assumptions it was superior to the univariate model for 1-month forecasts. The accuracy of the bivariate model improved significantly for 3-month forecasts if good forecasts of housing starts were available. The econometric model was more suitable for policy analysis. Future advances would be possible by a theoretical synthesis of the multivariate and econometric approaches.

ID ARIMA; DETERMINISTIC FUNCTION
AB The use of ARIMA time series models in forecasting is reviewed. In connection with this, some important points about forecasting are discussed, including: (1) difficulties in forecasting by fitting and extrapolating a deterministic function of time; (2) the importance of providing reasonable measures of forecast accuracy; and (3) the need to incorporate subject matter knowledge with time series models when forecasting.

TI TIME-SERIES MODELS TO SIMULATE AND FORECAST WIND-SPEED AND WIND POWER
SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE AND APPLIED METEOROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID WIND SPEED; WIND POWER; AUTOREGRESSIVE; 
   NON-GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION; WEATHER
AB A general approach for modeling wind speed and wind power is described. Because wind power is a function of wind speed, the methodology is based on the development of a model of wind speed. Values of wind power are estimated by applying the appropriate transformations to values of wind speed. The wind speed modeling approach takes into account several basic features of wind speed data, including autocorrelation, non-Gaussian distribution, and diurnal nonstationarity. The positive correlation between consecutive wind speed observations is taken into account by fitting an autoregressive process to wind speed data transformed to make their distribution approximately Gaussian and standardized to remove diurnal nonstationarity. As an example, the modeling approach is applied to a small set of hourly wind speed data from the Pacific Northwest. Use of the methodology for simulating and forecasting wind speed and wind power is discussed and an illustration of each of these types of applications is presented. To take into account the uncertainty of wind speed and wind power forecasts, techniques are presented for expressing the forecasts either in terms of confidence intervals or in terms of probabilities.

AB This paper presents a class of models which are designed for forecasting the net sales of a product when the stock of that product is believed to be subject to a saturation level. The forecast function for the stock takes the form of a general modified exponential, a family which includes the logistic as a special case. However, framing the model in terms of the net increase in the product enables a link to be made between the traditional approach to forecasting based on non-linear trend curves and the approach based on ARIMA models.

In the first approach, which we term' econometric 'or' model-based', forecasts of the exogenous variables based on their past values are inserted into the model, which is then solved to yield forecasts of the endogenous variables. The second approach uses only the past values of the variables in question, and the'time-series' forecast

AB The aim is to develop a heuristic method for estimating time-series models for forecasting. The study consists of two parts. This one presents the analytical framework of the proposed procedure; the second will present the actual algorithm and numerical evaluations of the process. Our approach makes use of the frequency-domain theory of second-order stochastic processes to remedy several of the problems that we encounter in fitting ARIMA-type models for forecasting. Within this framework some of the problems that the present study addresses are: sample size of time series, initial estimates of the coefficients, convergence of difficult data to stable estimates, and computing time.

ID BOX-JENKINS; LABOR PRODUCTIVITY
AB Plant labor productivity index, defined as the ratio of the standard labor hours and actual labor hours, is an important factor in the determination of the future manpower needs at Cessna Aircraft Co. (Pawnee Division). In this paper, a time series model based on the Box-Jenkins modelling approach is developed. A greater accuracy in forecasting future labor productivity index has been achieved by using this model.

AB Experiments contrasted judgmental and objective forecast methods. Judgmental methods included “eyeball” extrapolation of time‐series plots and judgmental adjustment. Objective methods included Box‐Jenkins (BJ), Carbone‐Longini AEP filtering (CL), Holt‐Winters (HW), and other smoothing techniques. Objective methods proved more accurate than eyeball extrapolation. However, judgmental adjustment improved the accuracy of some objective forecasts.

AB This paper compares the accuracy of three different inflation forecasting procedures. These include a univariate time-series model, an interest rate model based on the methodology of Fama and Gibbons, and the median forecasts derived from the American Statistical Association-National Bureau of Economic Research survey. The evidence presented is based on ex ante forecasts of quarterly inflation rates using the GNP deflator for the period 1970:I-1984:II. Based on the evidence presented, the general conclusion is that the survey forecasts provide the most accurate inflation forecasts.

AB This paper presents a descriptive synthesis of a number of a linear recursive estimator (LRE) procedures for time series forecasting, i.e., procedures which involve parameter updates proportional to the last period forecast error. It is stressed that both constant and variable parameter procedures exist among LRE's. General requirements for stability of parameter estimates are given, as are general forms for parameter estimate covariance matrices that appear in forecast variance determinations. Procedures explicitly considered are the Kalman filter, dynamic autoregression, the Carbone-Longini adaptive estimation procedure, generalized least squares, Widrow's least mean square, and the Makridakis-Wheelwright generalized adaptive filtering.

TI FORECASTING TRENDS IN TIME-SERIES

DT Article
ID EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING; TIME SERIES
AB Most time series methods assume that any trend will continue unabated, regardless of the forecast lead time. But recent empirical findings suggest that forecast accuracy can be improved by either damping or ignoring altogether trends which have a low probability of persistence. This paper develops an exponential smoothing model designed to damp erratic trends. The model is tested using the sample of 1,001 time series first analyzed by Makridakis et al. Compared to smoothing models based on a linear trend, the model improves forecast accuracy, particularly at long leadtimes. The model also compares favorably to sophisticated time series models noted for good long-range performance, such as those of Lewandowski and Parzen.

AB A stochastic filtering method is presented for on-line recursive estimation and forecasting of autocorrelated time series. Several state space models for nonseasonal and seasonal time series, which belong to the autoregressive integrated-moving average class, are presented. The Kalman filter is introduced as the recursive data processor for on-line time series forecasting. The estimation problem and initial values determination are discussed, and numerical examples are given. An extension of Brown's adaptive smoothing method for autocorrelated time series through the proposed filtering approach is also presented.

It utilizes Single exponential smoothing, Adaptive-response-rate single exponential smoothing, and Brown's double exponential smoothing methods to forecast the future values of a given time series. The program produces plots of the original time series and forecasted series as well as forecasting errors. It computes 90% and 95% confidence intervals for forecasted values and calculates the following statistics: Mean squared error, Mean absolute percentage error, Mean absolute error, Durbin-Watson statistic, and Theil's U statistic.

AB The paper shows how smoothing filters can be built into multivariate ARIhfA models. The technique can be especially useful for time series  with sizable irregular  fluctuations. These tend to blurr the  relationships  between the series, to disturb the forecasts and to underestimate  the  forecasting  performance. The approach proposed  circumvents  these problems, and is illustrated by joint ARIhlA forecasting of the Canadian Composite  Leading Indicator and the Index of Industrial  Production.

AB A wide variety of time series techniques are now used for generating forecasts of economic variables, with each technique attempting to summarize and exploit whatever regularities exist in a given data set. It appears that many researchers arbitrarily choose one of these techniques. The purpose of this article is to provide an example for which the choice of time series technique appears important; merely choosing arbitrarily among available techniques may lead to suboptimal results.

ID SALES; FORECASTING; ELECTRICITY, TIME‐SERIES; FORECASTING, END‐USE
AB Two types of forecasting methods have been receiving increasing attention by electric utility forecasters. The first type, called end‐use forecasting, is recognized as an approach which is well suited for forecasting during periods characterized by technological change. The method is straightforward. The stock levels of energy‐consuming equipment are forecast, as well as the energy consumption characteristics of the equipment. The final forecast is the product of the stock and usage characteristics. 
This approach is well suited to forecasting long time periods when technological change, equipment depletion and replacement, and other structural changes are evident. For time periods of shorter duration, these factors are static and variations are more likely to result from shocks to the environment. The shocks influence the usage of the equipment. A second forecasting approach using time‐series analysis has been demonstrated to be superior for these applications. This paper discusses the integration of the two methods into a unified system. The result is a time‐series model whose parameter effects become dynamic in character. An example of the models being used at the Georgia Power Company is presented. It is demonstrated that a time‐series model which incorporates end‐use stock and usage information is superior—even in short‐term forecasting situations—to a similar time‐series model which excludes the information.

AB This paper presents a procedure for forecasting average daily traffic using a time-series analysis. The procedure assumes a logistic function to model traffic volume over a period of years. Model parameters are estimated using ordinary least-squares regression. The method was tested empirically. Model parameters were found to be significant for each of the three different thoroughfares. Further, time-series forecasts compared favorably to observed traffic and to interpolated forecasts for the same period. The method is simpler to and more economical than the standard demand forecasting procedure and is recommended where land-use patterns are stable and only small modifications to the thoroughfare network are planned.

SO WATER RESOURCES BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
ID STATISTICS; TIME SERIES ANALYSIS; MUNICIPAL; 
   WATER USE; FORECASTING
AB A cascade model for forecasting municipal water use one week or one month ahead, conditioned on rainfall estimates, is presented and evaluated. The model comprises four components: long term trend, seasonal cycle, autocorrelation and correlation with rainfall. The increased forecast accuracy obtained by the addition of each component is evaluated. The City of Deerfield Beach, Florida, is used as the application example with the calibration period from 1976–1980 and the forecast period the drought year of 1981. Forecast accuracy is measured by the average absolute relative error (AARE, the average absolute value of the difference between actual and forecasted use, divided by the actual use). A benchmark forecast is calculated by assuming that water use for a given week or month in 1981 is the same as the average for the corresponding period from 1976 to 1980. This method produces an AARE of 14.6 percent for one step ahead forecasts of monthly data and 15.8 percent for weekly data. A cascade model using trend, seasonality and autocorrelation produces forecasts with AARE of about 12 percent for both monthly and weekly data while adding a linear relationship of water use and rainfall reduces the AARE to 8 percent in both cases if it is assumed that rainfall is known during the forecast period. Simple rainfall predictions do not increase the forecast accuracy for water use so the major utility of relating water use and rainfall lies in forecasting various possible water use sequences conditioned on sequences of historical rainfall data.

TI SAMPLING THE FUTURE - A BAYESIAN-APPROACH TO FORECASTING FROM UNIVARIATE

DT Article
ID ARIMA; BAYESIAN; MONTE CARLO
AB The Box-Jenkins methodology for modeling and forecasting from univariate time series models has long been considered a standard to which other forecasting techniques have been compared. To a Bayesian statistician, however, the method lacks an important faceta provision for modeling uncertainty about parameter estimates. We present a technique called "sampling the future" for including this feature in both the estimation and forecasting stages. Although it is relatively easy to use Bayesian methods to estimate the parameters in an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, there are severe difficulties in producing forecasts from such a model. The multiperiod predictive density does not have a convenient closed form, so approximations are needed. In this article, exact Bayesian forecasting is approximated by simulating the joint predictive distribution. First, parameter sets are randomly generated from the joint posterior distribution. These are then used to simulate future paths of the time series. This bundle of many possible realizations is used to project the future in several ways. Highest probability forecast regions are formed and portrayed with computer graphics. The predictive density's shape is explored. Finally, we discuss a method that allows the analyst to subjectively modify the posterior distribution on the parameters and produce alternate forecasts.

The analysis represents a wedding of demographic and statistical time series in models amenable to Box-Jenkins techniques of model identification, estimation, diagnosis, and forecasting. The models demonstrate the advantages in this approach in forecasting both rates and events as opposed to the common practice of simply forecasting events. Using the best models of indexes of fertility and nuptiality, forecasts of births and first marriages are made for the U.S. for the years 1983–2000. Analyses of these forecasts are made with discussions of their demographic realism in terms of their forecast confidence intervals.

ID ANALYSIS; BOX-JENKINS; INTERVENTION
AB Forecasting the effects of changes in advertising or pricing strategies on a company's sales or market share is an important task faced by marketing managers. This paper applies a time series approach, intervention analysis, to several marketing policy applications illustrating the flexibility and value of the method for testing hypotheses and providing forecasts. Empirical evidence is presented for two different marketing situations, one that involves a change in advertising and another that involves offering price specials.

AB In this paper a data analysis tool for analyzing highly correlated time series data is suggested. The main objective is to unify multiple time series into a single series and then apply a univariate method for the purpose of prediction. This method is essentially efficient for analyzing multiple time series with sparse data. Several time series data of relative demand for black and white television receivers in various countries are analyzed and quite accurate predictions are obtained.

AB A regular supply of applicants to Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario is provided by 65 high schools. Each high school can be characterized by a series of grading standards which change from year to year. To aid admissions decisions, it is desirable to forecast the current year's grading standards for all 65 high schools using grading standards estimated from past year's data. We develop and apply a Bayesian break‐point time‐series model that generates forecasts which involve smoothing across time for each school and smoothing across schools. “Break point” refers to a point in time which divides the past into the “old past” and the “recent past” where the yearly observations in the recent past are exchangeable with the observations in the year to be forecast. We show that this model works fairly well when applied to 11 years of Queen's University data. The model can be applied to other data sets with the parallel time‐series structure and short history, and can be extended in several ways to more complicated structures.

SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL

DT Article
ID ECONOMIC; STOCHASTIC; INTEREST RATE; EXOGENOUS VARIABLES; CONSUM
AB This study deals with simultaneous statistical analysis of several economic variables. It employs the well-known linear stochastic framework of state space theory. The analysis presented here differs from some other applications of this theory in many respects. As an illustration a case study of forecasting the interest rate in the short run is included. Since demand and supply of money affect the interest rate, these three variables are examined together. The relative lag-lead pattern in the movements of such key indicators is important for forecasting and decision-making. This aspect is specifically taken care of. Inflation rate and industrial production enter the illustration as exogenous variables to account for the effect of the economic environment. A fifth-order state space model having the three monetary variables as observations is estimated. This is a cause-and-effect system with the two exogenous variables serving as inputs. It is a more general representation than purely noise-driven vector autoregressions that have no exogenous variables. Furthermore, the distinction between process noise and observation noise has been retained. An analysis of movements in the interest rate is of considerable practical importance. Holdings of bonds and other financial assets undergo change in value with fluctuations in the interest rate. These couldlead to gains or losses for corporations as well as for individuals. The usefulness of forecasting the likely course of interest rates therefore arises. However, forecasting interest rates, like other economic variables, is not an easy task. Indeed, there are interest rate futures markets where trading takes place because different persons have varying assessments of their future level. While these markets provide hedging possibilities to cope with uncertainty, they also enable specu- lators to try to benefit from interest rate fluctuations. A considerable literature accordingly exists which deals with this issue. The theory suggests that variations in the supply of and demand for money bring about changes in its price which is the interest rate. Analysis should therefore incorporate the supply and demand factors. In addition, the broader economic environment involving real production and consumption also influences the price of money.

ID FORECASTING; FINANCIAL ANALYSTS; CONSENSUS, EARNINGS
AB An alternative to using a single forecasting method is to average the forecasts made by various methods. In this paper we examine empirically combinations of financial analysts' forecasts and forecasts from time series methods in order to predict corporate earnings per share. We conclude that, on average, the primary forecasting advantages of analysts over time series methods based on annual data appear to occur over short forecast horizons (less than a year). Neither analysts nor other time series methods substantially outperform a random walk prediction of no change when forecasts are made near the beginning of the fiscal year. For predictions in the first half of the fiscal year, there is evidence of forecasting benefits from combining time series and analysts' forecasts, especially if there are few analysts' forecasts.

AB The application of time series analysis methods to load forecasting is reviewed. It is shown than Box and Jenkins time series models, in particular, are well suited to this application. The logical and organized procedures for model development using the autocorrelation function and the partial autocorrelation function make these models particularly attractive. One of the drawbacks of these models is the inability to accurately represent the nonlinear relationship between load and temperature. A simple procedure for overcoming this difficulty is introduced, and several Box and Jenkins models are compared with a forecasting procedure currently used by a utility company.

DT Article
ID AGGREGATION; ARIMA; FORECAST EFFICIENCY; LINEAR COMBINATION; MODELLING; SYTEMATIC SAMPLING
AB This paper reviews and extends several aspects of the analysis of linear combinations of time series. Special cases are temporal and contemporaneous aggregations and systematic sampling. We present some simple examples, a unified notation, references to the literature, and some general results for linear combinations of scalar and vector time series. For basic time series following ARIMA models in scalar cases we derive the ARIMA models of the linear combinations as functions of those of the basic series in both the nonseasonal and seasonal cases. For vector time series we compare the forecast efficiencies of two alternative approaches: first model and forecast and then form the linear combination, and first form the linear combination and then model and forecast; for this analysis we use the moving average representation of a stationary time series. A final section contains an application to monthly data on milk production and milk productivity series for the State of São Paulo, Brazil.

AB Accurate forecasts of passenger and cargo loads in the commercial airline industry are crucial. The methodologies available for forecasting air traffic are as diverse as the applications. A time-series procedure is described for forecasting short-term, point-to-point (city-to-city) scheduled air traffic. A novel forecasting approach is suggested that combines decomposition and stochastic modeling methods in a multistage procedure. First is a decomposition during which 2 instruments are created from the original time series. Then, each instrument is modeled individually using stochastic techniques. Finally, the models are recombined to produce a forecast. The technique is applied to quarterly passenger data taken from Table 8 of the Civil Aeronautics Board origin-destination survey. The city pair is New York City-Los Angeles. An improvement in ex post predictive precision is noted. A major feature of the method is its handling of seasonality.

DT Article
ID VOLATILE; PRICE; STOCK; BAYESIAN; KALMAN
AB Volatile time series are part of the industrial engineering forecasting and planning environment. An example of a volatile time series is the daily closing price of a stock, such as IBM, which is adaptively forecasted in this paper. Volatile series are beset with random shocks, from day-to-day, which may be characterized as 1) no charge in the series, 2) a step change, 3) a ramp change, or 4) a transient change. These random shocks are referred to as states of the time series. Probabilities for the various states are determined (computationally and subjectively) and are combined with the Bayesian results of Kaiman (3, 6) to update adaptively a forecasting equation. The method, therefore, is a multi-state procedure which embeds the Bayesian estimation method of Kalman. To illustrate the technique, a linear forecasting equation is used to predict the daily closing prices of IBM stock for 79 trading days starting on September 8 and extending to December 29, 1987; a period which includes the “crash” of October 19, 1987. In general seasonality may be added, if desired. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with Kalman's results.

AB This paper examines the forecasting performance of the Wharton model (MARK III) over the period 1973 through 1975 and compares it with that of ARIMA models' performance over the same period. Despite strong intimation in the literature to the contrary, we find that this econometric model, at least, exhibits greater accuracy in every respect relative to ARIMA methods, in terms of its forecasts cum constant adjustments. When constant adjustments are disallowed then its forecasts are still more accurate than ARIMA forecasts over a 4- and 8-quarter forecasting horizon, but less accurate over a 1-quarter horizon. The comparison was carried out over twenty three macrovariables, under a slight handicap for the Wharton Model, in that the latter's parameters were estimated over a sample ending in 1969.3 while the ARIMA models were reidentified and reestimated as of the quarter immediately preceding the forecast.

AB An important test of the adequecy of a stochastic model is its ability to forecast accurately. In hydrology as in many other disciplines, the performance of the model in producing one step ahead forecasts is of particular interest. The ability of several stationary nonseasonal time series models to produce accurate forecasts is examined in this paper. Statistical tests are employed to determine if the forecasts generated by a particular model are better than the forecasts produced by an alternative procedure. The results of the study indicate that for the data sets examined, there is no significant difference in forecast performance between the nonseasonal autoregressive moving average model and a nonparametric regression model.

AB Relations between forecasting and time series analysis have been somewhat strained in the past; this paper attempts to point some of the benefits which could accrue from a closer liaison. Among the issues discussed are the behefits (if any) of including explanatory variables, the need for more systematic updating of forecasting models, and issues of forecasting horizons and method selection. Developments in multiple series modeling and in forecasting intrinsically nonlinear systems are also examined.

AB Time-series forecasting methods may be classified into univariate (projection) methods and multivariate methids. The choice amongst methods depends on a variety of considerations including the objectives, the type of data, and whether an automatic or unautomatic approach is to be used. The value of forecasting competitions is reviewed and suggestions are made regarding the forthcoming M2-competition. Various unsolved research problems relating to different univariate and multivariate methods are outlined. The difficulties of fitting multivariate models to economic data are discussed and it is suggested that univariate procedures will continue to have wide use in practice. The impact of proliferating computer software is considered and some desirable features of ‘good’ packages are listed.

AB A selected group of nine climate-sensitive tree-ring chronologies from old post oak trees are used to reconstruct the June Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) from 1698 to 1980 for two large regions in northern and southern Texas. Analysis of tree growth and monthly climate variables indicate that the June PDSI is the most robust climate signal evident in these chronologies, and principal component analysis (PCA) reveals a north-south geographic pattern in the relationships between the regional tree-ring time series. Serially random amplitude series from the first two significant eigenvectors of tree growth, which explain 65% of the total variance in the tree-ring data, were entered into stepwise multiple regression as predictors of regionally averaged June PDSI in north and south Texas for the common interval 1931-80. The regression models explain 59% and 60% of the Variance in north and south Texas June PDSI, respectively, and both reconstructions are well verified against independent June PDSI data available on a statewide basis from 1888 to 1930. The weak persistence present in the observed June PDSI series was added to the serially random tree-ring reconstructions prior to verification, using autoregressive modeling procedures.
   The mean and variance of June PDSI during the 50-yr period of meteorological observation (1931-80) appear to be representative of the last 283 yr, but significant changes in average June PDSI for Texas appear to have occurred over both 30 and similar to 90-yr time intervals. Moderate or more severe June droughts (PDSI <= -2.0) have an estimated recurrence probability of over 90% each decade, and the risk of extreme June drought (PDSI <= -4.0) is estimated at over 50% every 15 yr in north Texas and every 10 yr in south Texas. The reconstructions faithfully reproduce the frequency domain properties of the actual June PDSI, and marginally significant spectral peaks are present at 2.3 yr and between 14 and 18.67 yr in both reconstructions. Significant interannual persistence of June moisture extremes apparent in the statewide June temperature, precipitation, and PDSI data from 1888 to 1982 is also present in both regional reconstructions from 1698 to 1980. The reconstructions indicate that the risk for below average June moisture conditions increases to at least 65% in north and south Texas in the summer following a June drought (PDSI <= -2.0). Interannual persistence is also indicated for June wetness anomalies and may have some modest value in statistical forecasts of growing season moisture conditions in Texas.

AB This paper is concerned with time series methods in the time domain for the determination of satisfactory models for observed phenomena. The data series used here for illustrative purposes is a volume index of imports. A range of methods is embraced with a view to considering the possibility of using more than one model as an adequate representation of the underlying data generating mechanism. Autoregressive-moving average models are employed in a somewhat novel way and also in a Bayesian manner. We also report the results of applying structural time series models to the data. The different models which emerge are then used for the purposes of generating forecasts. Some of these forecasts are combined using regression methods to provide a single ex ante forecast.

ID CHEBYSHEV INEQUALITY; EMPIRICAL APPROACH; PREDICTION
AB Theoretical approaches to computing prediction intervals require strong assumptions that do not appear to hold in practice. This paper presents an empirical approach to prediction intervals that assumes very little. During model-fitting, variances of the errors are computed at different forecast leadtimes. Using these variances, the Chebyshev inequality is applied to determine prediction intervals. Empirical evidence is presented to show that this approach gives reasonable results. For example, using the 111 series in the M-competition, 95% prediction intervals actually contain 95.8% of post-sample observations.

TI The Potential Impacts of a Scenario of CO2-Induced Climatic Change on

SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE

ID GREAT-LAKES; MODEL
AB In 1984, Environment Canada, Ontario Region, with financial and expert support from the Canadian Climate Program, initiated an interdisciplinary pilot study to investigate the potential impact, on Ontario, of a climate scenario which might be anticipated under doubling of atmospheric CO2 conditions.
   There were many uncertainties involved in the climate scenario development and the impacts modeling. Time and resource constraints restricted this study to one climate scenario and to the selection of several available models that could be adapted to these impact studies. The pilot study emphasized the approach and process required to investigate potential regional impacts in an interdisciplinary manner, rather than to produce a forecast of the future.
   The climate scenario chosen was adapted from experimental model results produced by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), coupled with current climate normals. Gridded monthly mean temperatures and precipitation were then used to develop projected biophysical effects. For example, existing physical and/or statistical models were adapted to determine impacts on the Great Lakes net basin supplies, levels and outflows, streamflow subbasin, snowfall and length of snow season.
   The second phase of the study addressed the impacts of the climate system scenario on natural resources and resource dependent activities. For example, the impacts of projected decreased lake levels and outflows on commercial navigation and hydroelectric generation were assessed. The impacts of the climate scenario on municipal water use, residential heating and cooling energy requirements, opportunities and constraints for food production and tourism and recreation were determined quantitatively where models and methodologies were available, otherwise, qualitatively.
   First order interdependencies of the biophysical effects of the climate scenario and resource dependent activities were evaluated qualitatively in a workshop format culminating in a series of statements on (i) possible preventive, compensatory and substitution strategies and (ii) an assessment of current knowledge gaps and deficiencies, with recommendations for future areas of research.

TI FORECASTING ECONOMIC TIME-SERIES THAT REQUIRE A POWER TRANSFORMATION -
   CASE OF STATE-TAX RECEIPTS
SO JOURNAL OF FORECASTING
LA English
DT Article
ID SEASONAL MODELS; POWER TRANSFORMATION; BAYESIAN; INFORMATION CRITERION
AB In this study, time series analysis is applied to the problem of forecasting state income tax receipts. The data series is of special interest since it exhibits a strong trend with a high multiplicative seasonal component. An appropriate model is identified by simultaneous estimation of the parameters of the power transformation and the ARMA model using the Schwarz (1978) Bayesian information criterion. The forecasting performance of the time series model obtained from this procedure is compared with alternative time series and regression models. The study illustrates how an information criterion can be employed for identifying time series models that require a power transformation, as exemplified by state tax receipts. It also establishes time series analysis as a viable technique for forecasting state tax receipts.

ID SALES FORECASTING; FORECASTING ACCURACY; JUDGEMENTAL FORECASTING
AB The contribution of product and industry knowledge to the accuracy of sales forecasting was investigated by examining the company forecasts of a leading manufacturer and marketer of consumable products. The company forecasts of 18 products produced by a meeting of marketing, sales, and production personnel were compared with those generated by the same company personnel when denied specific product knowledge and with the forecasts of selected judgemental and statistical time series methods. Results indicated that product knowledge contributed significantly to forecast accuracy and that the forecast accuracy of company personnel who possessed industry forecasting knowledge (but not product knowledge) was not significantly different from the time series based methods. Furthermore, the company forecasts were more accurate than averages of the judgemental and statistical time series forecasts. These results point to the importance of specific product information to forecast accuracy and accordingly call into question the continuing strong emphasis on improving extrapolation techniques without consideration of the inclusion of non‐time series knowledge.

AB A dividend-ratio model is introduced here that makes the log of the dividend-price ratio on a stock linear in optimally forecast future one-period real discount rates and future one-period growth rates of real dividends. If ex post discount rates are observable, this model can be tested by using vector autoregressive methods. Four versions of the linearized model, differing in the measure of discount rates, are tested for U.S. time series 1871-1986 and 1926-1986: a version that imposes constant real discount rates, and versions that measure discount rates from real interest rate data, aggregate real consumption data, and return variance data. The results yield a metric to judge the relative importance of real dividend growth, measured real discount rates, and unexplained factors in determining the dividend-price ratio.

TI Interannual Variations in the Southern Hemisphere Circulation
SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
LA English
DT Article
ID ECMWF; EOFS; GEOPOTENTIAL ANOMALIES; ANTARCTICA
AB An analysis has been made of variations in the atmospheric circulation with periods of more than 50 days occurring in the Southern Hemisphere between 1980 and 1986, using analyses produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), mainly at the 500 hPa level. A smoothed mean annual cycle was removed from the data to define anomalies which were then filtered to retain variations with periods greater than 50 days. The >50 day period variations account for 20%-30% of the variance of daily 500 hPa geopotential anomalies at midlatitudes, up to 50% over Antarctica and more than 70% in the tropics. The total variance was found to be more uniform at high latitudes over the southern oceans than reported in previous studies, possibly reflecting the more comprehensive dataset used in the ECMWF analyses.
   The first three empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of the geopotential height anomalies accounted for 40% of the low-pass filtered fields. The first is a zonal field with the sign of the anomalies reversing near 60 degrees S and a three-wave pattern superimposed at midlatitudes. The second and third have nearly equal eigenvalues and resemble two interleaved wave trains at middle and high latitudes. The first EOF is seen to be related to barotropic variations in the zonally averaged westerly wind which are preceded a few days earlier by changes in the poleward eddy momentum flux. The concomitant changes in energy integrals and conversions averaged over the hemisphere are small. While time series of the EOF coefficients show persistent anomalies of up to 4 months duration, the correlations between the series are small and add nothing to the predictability resulting from persistence over the 3 week period in which their autocorrelations remain positive.
   Plots of both the trajectories of the daily analyses and the distribution of persistent events in phase space, projected on to the planes of the principal axes of variation, showed little or no indication of concentration about multiple equilibria. Cluster analysis also failed to compress the original distribution to a small number of clusters unless some totally uncorrelated states were grouped together.
   Taken overall, these results are not encouraging to those seeking to develop long-range forecasting schemes for the Southern Hemisphere. Even with synoptic scale variations removed, the resulting anomaly patterns show great variety and little evidence for preferred paths between them. Apparently, on this time scale at least, the atmosphere does not conform to the predictions of nonlinear theory or to the behavior of simple nonlinear models.

AB The purpose of this paper is two-fold: it recognizes the importance of modeling and forecasting as a future-oriented decision-making process in the field of health care by proposing to model and forecast monthly patient movements in individual hospitals by means of the Box-Jenkins univariate and Tiao-Box multiple time series approaches; and it attempts to determine the choice between the univariate method and the multivariate approach in the case of hospital patient data. The forecasting performance of the resulting models is evaluated against the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing model using the mean squared error, mean absolute deviation, and mean absolute percentage error, for five non-overlapping time periods. The test results suggest that the proper choice of time series techniques to be applied to hospital admissions and discharges has an important and direct bearing on the reliability of forecasting results. Therefore, the practical implications and usefulness of time series techniques and models are discussed.

TI MODELING AND FORECASTING THE FISHERY FOR PILCHARD (SARDINA-PILCHARDUS)
   IN GREEK WATERS USING ARIMA TIME-SERIES MODELS
SO JOURNAL DU CONSEIL

DT Article
ID ARIMA; FISHERY, BOX-JENKINS
AB  A 17-year record (1964–1980, 204 observations) of monthly catches of pilchard ( Sardina pilchardus ) from Greek waters was analysed using AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) techniques (Box and Jenkins, 1976). Two models were found to be suitable for describing the dynamics of the fishery and for forecasting up to 12 months ahead: X t =X t−1 +X t−12 −X t−13 +e t −0.539e t−12 −0.289e t−1 +0.156e t−13 
and X 1 =X t−1 +X t−12 −X 1−13 +e t −0.537e t−12 −0.391e t−1 +0.21e t−13 −0.255e t−2 +0.137e t−14, where X t = landings in month t, and e t = error term in month t. Forecasts were compared with actual data for 1981 that were not used in the estimation of the parameters of either model. Mean error was 14.6% and 12 % for the two models, respectively. This suggests that ARIMA procedures are capable of describing and forecasting the complex dynamics of the Greek pilchard fishery, which have hitherto been regarded as difficult to predict owing to the strong influence of year-to-year changes in oceanographic and biological conditions and socio-economic factors (low commercial value and demand, high discard rate).

AB This article presents new evidence about the time-series behavior of stock prices. Daily return series exhibit significant levels of second-order dependence, and they cannot be modeled as linear white-noise processes. A reasonable return-generating process is empirically shown to be a first-order autoregressive process with conditionally heteroscedastic innovations. In particular, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic GARCH (1, 1) processes fit to data very satisfactorily. Various out-of-sample forecasts of monthly return variances are generated and compared statistically. Forecasts based on the GARCH model are found to be superior.

TI Spectral Estimation from Time Series Models with Relevance to the

SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE

ID FREQUENCY; SPECTRAL; SOTHERN OSCILLATION; SO; POWER; QUASI-PERIODIC
AB The theoretical spectra of certain parametric time series models with relevance to the Southern Oscillation (SO) are determined and compared with those based on a frequency-domain approach. Consistent spectral estimates are found for the two models selected in our earlier studies of the SO. All these results yield larger power at low frequencies and a dominant peak around 3-4 yr. Some reasons are offered for the slightly different behavior of the spectra as derived from the time-domain and frequency-domain approaches.
   For the sake of comparison, the spectra of other simpler time series models are also calculated. While larger power is found at low frequencies, no spectral peak exists in these simpler models. Some implications of the quasi-periodic behavior found in the more complex models (i.e., an intermediate peak in the spectrum) are discussed in the context of the persistence and forecasting of the SO.

ID HOLT-WINTERS; ARIMA; ;IARIMA; RMA
AB The purpose of this paper is to compare the accuracy of five forecasting models for monthly earnings per share data, a seasonal time series. The five models are Holt-Winters exponential smoothing model (HW), Box-Jenkins ARIMA Model (BJ), linear regression of data deseasonalized by the Census II-X11 method (X11), linear regression of data deseasonalized by the X11-ARIMA method (X11ARIMA), linear regression of data deseasonalized by the ratio-to-moving-average method. Study of earnings per share data is important because (1) these data exhibit all the systematic components of a time series, (2) earnings per share forecasts are important for purposes of financial decision making and strategic planning, and (3) previous studies of earnings per share data did not compare these five forecasting models.

AB Provisional estimates of mortality for selected causes of death are published each month by the National Center for Health Statistics. These estimates are based upon a ten per cent sample of death certificates in the United States. Final mortality results, based upon all the death certificates for a calendar year, are available one to two years after publication of the provisional estimates. This paper explores the potential of time series forecasting techniques for improving mortality estimates by using the correlation structure between the provisional and final series to obtain mortality estimates that are expected to be closer to final values than currently used provisional estimates.

AB Often a forecaster has supplementary information (e.g. field reports or forecasts from another source) that cannot be included directly in a time series model. Especially interesting are cases where this information is given at time intervals that are different from those of the time series model forecasts. Previous authors have considered a numerical and a model‐based statistical method for combining extra‐model information of this type with ARIMA model forecasts. This paper extends both methods to vector ARMA model forecasts and dynamic regression (transfer function) model forecasts. It is also shown that a Lagrange multiplier numerical procedure arises as a special case of the model‐based procedure. An empirical example is given.

AB Most forecasting methods are based on equally spaced data. In the case of missing observations the methods have to be modified. We have considered three smoothing methods: namely, simple exponential smoothing; double exponential smoothing; and Holt's method. We present a new, unified approach to handle missing data within the smoothing methods. This approach is compared with previously suggested modifications. The comparison is done on 12 real, non‐seasonal time series, and shows that the smoothing methods, properly modified, usually perform well if the time series have a moderate number of missing observations.

ID JUDGEMENT; CALIBRATION; CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
AB This paper examines the accuracy (calibration) of judgemental and selected statistical confidence intervals in time series forecasting. Using the forecasts and forecast errors produced by the deseasonalized single exponential smoothing method, three statistical intervals were produced utilizing three assumptions about the distribution of errors: the normal distribution, the empirical distribution and the distribution based on the Chebyshev inequality. Using 33 real‐life time series, results indicated that the judgemental confidence intervals were initially excessively overconfident, thus confirming the finding of Lichtenstein et al. (1982). However, calibration of the judgemental intervals improved considerably with feedback, and was found to be influenced by the degree of forecasting difficulty of the series.

TI FORECASTING HALIBUT BIOMASS USING SYSTEM THEORETIC TIME-SERIES METHODS
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English

ID HALIBUT BIOMASS; LINEAR SYSTEMS; FISHERIES; ECONOMIC
AB A new procedure introduced by Masanao Aoki uses the ideas of linear systems theory to identify and estimate time-series models. A slightly modified version of this procedure is used to forecast halibut biomass in total and by regulatory area and subarea, and the out-of-sample forecasts are evaluated for eight years. All models produce highly accurate forecasts of biomass, with errors well within the bounds required for setting catch limits in the following year.

TI FORECASTING THE LOCAL ECONOMY, USING TIME-SERIES AND SHIFT-SHARE

ID ECONOMY; SHIFT-SHARE
AB Although shift – share is an inexpensive and easy means of making regional forecasts, its accuracy depends on the method used in forecasting the competitive component of the region. As theory is unclear as to the sign, let alone the magnitude, of the competitive component of the next period, it would be appropriate to use time-series techniques to forecast it. Unfortunately the typical method of application of shift–share results in too few data points for the application of time-series analysis. In this paper an alternative method of calculating the competitive component that resolves that problem is presented. In an empirical test of the technique, time-series methods are used to forecast the competitive series for a metropolitan region. The results are found to compare favorably with the forecasts of other techniques.

TI An Operational Multifield Analog/Anti-Analog Prediction System for

   Intermediate 3-Month Period Experiments
SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
LA English
DT Article
ID TEMPERATURE; WEATHER; WINTER; PETTERN
AB An expanded version of the multifield analog prediction system developed by Barnett and Preisendorfer (1978) was described and applied to the winter season in Part I of this two-part series (Livezey and Barnston 1988). This second part reviews briefly the major design features detailed in Part I, and then describes the predictive skills in spring, summer, fall and all other intermediate 3-month seasons.
   In none of the 11 nonwinter seasons is the United States surface temperature predicted with as much skill as in winter. The major winter skill peak (16%) extends partially into the following two seasons (January-February-March and February-March-April), and a secondary maximum in summer (13%) similarly includes the two following seasons (July August September and August-September-October). In both skillful periods of the year the skill tends to be greatest over the eastern third of the United States and the immediate Pacific Coast, and lowest over the Rockies and Plateau. More predictor variables are used as criteria for analog selection during the skillful times of the year, while fewer are found to contribute to skill levels at other times. The annual cycle of skill of simple persistence forecasts has its primary maximum in August-September-October, when it slightly exceeds the skill of the analog method, and a secondary maximum in winter when it is outperformed by the analog method by a substantial margin. The analog-forecasted temperature patterns are found to be statistically largely independent of the temperature patterns of persistence forecasts at all times of the year.
   In an exercise aimed at determining which part of the predicted period within the season is most skillfully forecast, it is found that from fall through winter the later month(s) of the season are better predicted than the earlier months, suggesting a potential for useful long-lead forecasting of subseasonal periods in much of the coldest part of the year.

AB An analog selection method relying on the coincidence of main features (large-scale ridge lines) in the Northern Hemisphere is presented and used for making 30-day weather forecasts for Hungary. Numerous analog model trials were tested, with the aid of the advance selection of the "best circulation analogs" of the Atlantic-European forecast region, for every target month of the 27-yr calibration period and the 5.5 yr test period. The best predictor types are a one pentad (i.e., 5-day) predictor period with spatial smoothing (allowing slight longitudinal shifts between pressure patterns), and a 2 pentad predictor period with time averaging (with a weighting factor of 0.4 on data from outside the forecast region in both cases). A subset of each group of analogs with similar circulations during the forecast period was identified. Using the subset leads to further significant increases in skill.
   Monthly weather forecasts for temperature (5-day subperiods) and precipitation quantity (10-day subperiods) in any of three climatologically equal probable categories were given. Different statistics, which were slightly but significantly better than chance expectation and persistence, were employed to assess the skill of the forecasts. By means of the previously chosen best circulation analogs, the potential monthly analog predictability based on our dataset and methods were also determined. Accordingly, the operable forecasting method realizes 30%-60% of potential predictability. Using lengthened data series for selecting analogs, the improvement in both analog predictability and actual forecasting skills was investigated. Extrapolating the experimental data for the future by comparing it with a logistic curve, an estimate was obtained of increased forecast skill from the present 38%-39% to 42% within 15 yr.

ID MODEL FORECAST; TIME SERIES MODEL; AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION; 
   MEAN ABSOLUTE PERCENT ERROR; MORTALITY PROBABILITY 
AB This article links parameterized model mortality schedules with time series methods to develop forecasts of U.S. mortality to the year 2000. The use of model mortality schedules permits a relatively concise representation of the history of mortality by age and sex from 1900 to 1985, and the use of modern time series methods to extend this history forward to the end of this century allows for a flexible modeling of trend and the accommodation of changes in long-run mortality patterns. This pilot study demonstrates that the proposed procedure produces medium-range forecasts of mortality that meet the standard tests of accuracy in forecast evaluation and that are sensible when evaluated against the comparable forecasts produced by the Social Security Administration.

TI TIME-SERIES DECOMPOSITION AND FORECASTING
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
ID SMOOTH; AUTOCORRELATION; OPTIMIZATION
AB Any stationary time-series can be decomposed by means of an optimization operator, called the ζ-optimator, into several components (the time-series){Y t i}, i =1,2,…, p, such that the first component {V t i} t = 1,2,…,v is a smooth process having a larger autocorrelation in comparison with the original process {Y t}, i.e. ρvi > ρy. Usually only a few such components are sufficient for approximating the time-series with good accuracy. The ζ-optimator involves a shape parameter a, so the decomposition is unique provided that a. is fixed. Since the component {V t 1} involves much of the useful information it can be used for computing predictors for control purposes. Thus, given the observations Yv, Yv-1, Yv-2,…, a predictor of Yv+1 is ρvi V v 1 (q) where, Vv 1(q) = qYv + q(1-q)2 Yv-2, …, the weights q(1-q)r, r=0,1,2,…, decreasing rapidly as q = q(α) ε (0,1) Further, one may choose q rather than choosing α, since q(α) is a one-one mapping. Once q is fixed, the predictor ρv1 V v 1(q) is obtained in a straightforward way by using the formula above. It is shown that ρv1 V v 1(q) converges to the best predictor as α → 0. Some examples are worked out, illustrating both the decomposition and the forecasting procedures.

AB This article demonstrates the value of microdata for understanding the effect of wages on life cycle fertility dynamics. Conventional estimates of neoclassical economic fertility models obtained from linear aggregate time series regressions are widely criticized for being nonrobust when adjusted for serial correlation. Moreover, the forecasting power of these aggregative neoclassical models has been shown to be inferior when compared with conventional time series models that assign no role to wages. This article demonstrates that, when neoclassical models of fertility are estimated on microdata using methods that incorporate key demographic restrictions and when they are properly aggregated, they have considerable forecasting power.

ID COMPOSITE APPROACH; COTTON PRICE FORECAST; MULTI-DIMENSIONAL
   STRUCTURAL MODEL; VECTOR AUTOREGRESSION
AB This paper examines the predictive performance of structural and vector autorregressive models for forecasting monthly cotton prices. Two distinct time periods were selected for testing: a period of major policy shock, and a period of more normal market conditions. The study also investigates a composite approach, using vector autoregressions to determine the future values of exogenous variables of the structural model. Multi-dimensional testing procedures were adopted to evaluate the accuracy of forecasts. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the structural model in handling major policy changes, while the time series approach shows greater accuracy in forecasting normal price movement. Although the composite approach failed to show improvement in forecasting accuracy, a joint specification of the structural model and the time series properties of exogenous variables may merit further investigations.

ID ARIMA MODEL; DATA REVISIONS; KALMAN FILTER; 
   TIME SERIES ANALYSIS, TRANSFER FUNCTION
AB The first preliminary values of the monthly index of Finnish industrial production undergo a major revision once a year. The problem discussed in this paper is how to take this into account when forecasting the index using a transfer function model based on quick indicators. The preliminary values may be interpreted as measurements with error and handled in the state space framework as proposed in the literature. However, if one forecasts beyond the period for which preliminary values are available, this does not lead to any significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to the case in which the preliminary values are treated as final values without any error. This outcome simplifies the forecasting procedure in this specific example, and has to do with improved quality of the preliminary values of the index over time.

TI A MODIFICATION OF TIME-SERIES FORECASTING METHODS FOR HANDLING ANNOUNCED
   PRICE INCREASES
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper deals with a modification of exponential smoothing forecasting methods to allow for announced price increases. Such price increases occur frequently and at irregular intervals of time. We suggest a procedure that consists basically of an adjustment to sales plus exponential smoothing, moving indices to normalize the original sales data, and modification of the forecast. Numerical results are reported for several time series. The approach is particulary useful for forecasting in an economy with a high inflation rate.

TI TIME-SERIES DECOMPOSITION USING THE SINUSOIDAL MODEL
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper empirically supports the hypothesis that a sinusoidal model can be used successfully to decompose time-series data into its components. Since the length of the seasonal cycle is known, this study documents how one makes use of this known length to infer characteristics of the more general non-seasonal cycle. By examining the ratios of the lengths of the longer to the shorter sine waves in the resulting fit of a sinusoidal model, one is able to determine which sine waves are estimating the same cycle and what the average length of that cycle is. A non-linear trend is estimated by adding a sine wave to the linear trend.

TI THE FORECASTING ACCURACY OF REGIONAL BAYESIAN VAR MODELS WITH
   ALTERNATIVE NATIONAL VARIABLE CHOICES
SO INTERNATIONAL REGIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID AUTOREGRESSIVE; UNIT-ROOT
AB The forecasting accuracy of vector autoregressive (VAR) and Bayesian VAR (BVAR) versions of five different regional models are compared for three states. Two base models for each state consist of three national variables and three state variables. Three misspecified models are then constructed by substituting or adding a simulated (random) national variable to the base models. Forecasting accuracy is measured by each model's ability to forecast the three state variables one, four, and eight quarters ahead. Inclusion of the random variable generally reduces the forecasting accuracy of unrestricted VAR models. The BVAR technique is superior to the VAR approach in terms of forecasting accuracy but, more important, is largely insensitive to the choice of national variables, even when the misspecified national variable is included.

ID INFLATION; INTEREST; RATE; CONSUMER; PRICE
AB It has been suggested that inflation forecasts derived from short-term interest rates are as accurate as time-series forecasts. Previous analyses of this notion have focused on U.S. data, providing mixed results. In this article we extend previous work by testing the hypothesis using data taken from the U.S. and five other countries. Using monthly Euro-rates and the consumer price index (CPI) for the period 1967-86, our results indicate that time-series forecasts of inflation have equal or lower forecast errors and have unbiased predictions more often than the interest-rate-based forecasts.

AB Interim targets of the central bank and information variable in the forecast of the money multiplier. - The forecast of the money multiplier is a key issue in the use of monetary policy objectives. The quality of such a forecast determines the accuracy of the monetary control by the central bank. The author develops and evaluates an empirical multiplier forecasting methodology by combining monthly observations of the money supply with weekly interest rate observations. The resulting forecast provides a more effective guideline for central bank operations than previously recommended procedures. Empirical results based on US data for the period 1975-86 show that the predictive models used here are robust to changes in the US monetary policy regime.

ID STOCHASTIC MODELS; COMPUTER PROGRAMMING; FORECASTING
AB A unified, fully recursive approach to the modeling and forecasting of nonstationary time series is presented. The basic time-series model, based on the well-known component or structural form, is formulated in state-space terms. A novel spectral decomposition procedure, based on the exploitation of recursive smoothing algorithms, is then used to simplify the procedures of model identification and estimation. The fully recursive formulation allows for conventional or self-adaptive implementation of state-space forecasting and seasonal adjustment. Although the presentation is restricted to the consideration of univariate time series, the basic approach can be extended to handle explanatory variables or full multivariable (vector) series.

AB The global distribution of atmospheric angular momentum (M) during 1977-1978 and 1982-1983 is examined to identify evidence of prominent short term interchanges of relative atmospheric momentum between mid and high latitude zones, in both hemispheres.  Thirty day detrended angular momentum time series, prepared from the NMC gridded zonal wind data are examined in latitude bands.  These data exhibit obvious quasi-coherent oscillations with periods near 30 days plus variations with shorter periods.  An examination of latitude/altitude cross sections of zonal winds reveals that the oscillations are present almost simultaneously at all altitude levels between 1000 and 50 mb.  Cross latitude teleconnections, evident as strong anticorrelated signatures between adjacent latitude bands are observed in the midlatitudes of both hemispheres.  Comparison of these signatures with the time integrated flux of angular momentum across the nodal interface confirms that direct eddy transport of momentum is occurring.  Transport of momentum from the mid latitude bands results in an increase in the momentum of the higher latitude bands and vice versa.  Transport of planetary angular momentum by a Hadley/Ferrel type meridional circulation is specifically ruled out although that process may contribute to seasonal and longer term modulations.  The short term oscillations in M can reach magnitudes which dominate the global variation in momentum, as noted in the recent 1982-83 El Nino episode in which the January 1983 momentum peaked at a decadal high.  Similar "El-Nino like" changes in the trans-latitude momentum redistribution are observed in the Southern Hemisphere winters, following the Northern Hemisphere episode.  Overall, our results confirm and describe in more detail the long recognized fact that momentum can be selectively redistributed between tropical, temperate, and high latitudes, in patterns indicative of the development and dissipation of interacting regions, described variously in studies of the 'index cycle', 'seesaws' and 'teleconnections'.  In emphasizing the large scale coordination of these interchanges, and moreover their occasional very short time scales, these results will hopefully stimulate studies relating atmospheric behavior in distant regions thereby contributing to improvements in forecasting the circulation process.

AB In this paper field strength profiles are considered as time series and the use of some prediction techniques in the hand-off process is examined in order to have meaningful handovers.
   Different forecasting methods are here considered taking into account parameters as memory size requirements, weighting factors and its effect on the mean square error as well as method applicability.  A forecasting method is selected and the obtained results are used in novel handover procedures.  This procedures use multiple threshold and take into account trend variation.  Application results including effect on number of hand-offs are here presented and it was observed a reduction on number of hand offs for the examined profiles respect to methods that rely only on current field strength measurements.

were gen-erated as the outcome of a laboratory experi-ment, where a high degree of control on omitted variables was present, or maybe the data were generated as the outcome of a real-world economy where no control was present;

LA English
DT Article; Proceedings Paper
ID DEMAND; GROWING; SIMULATION
AB Estimates of the peak demand pertaining to a typical fast-growing system with inherit dynamic load characteristics are derived from three classical time-series forecasting methods. These demand estimates are compared with corresponding actual values. It is shown that application of sophisticated technological classical forecasting techniques to the forecasting problem of a typical fast-growing utility with dynamic load characteristics gives peak demand forecasts with varying degree of accuracy over the forecasting periods considered. This is mainly due to the inherent inability of these methods to simulate the complex load characteristics arising from the interactions of seasonality, trend, and cyclic moving special events. An attempt is made to isolate the effects of these events and to separately forecast the static and dynamic components of the system demand. The accuracy of the forecasted demand thus obtained is comparatively better than that of the forecast obtained.

ID TIME-SERIES; CASH FLOW; INVESTMENT; ARMA
AB The subject of this paper is modelling and forecasting of cash flows generated by a capital investment. The paper proposes the application of autoregressive, moving average, and mixed autoregressive moving‐average processes to capital budgeting. In addition, models for deterministic, stochastic and seasonal trends are considered. For each class of cash flows, analytical expressions are developed for the mean and variance of a project's net present value (NPV). Also considered are several equilibrium pricing models. For two of them, the forecasting methodology developed here is integrated into the pricing equation. Although the overall emphasis of the paper is on modelling and forecasting of cash flows, the implications for NPV pricing and risk analysis are also investigated. Several examples are used to illustrate the impact of particular cash flow models on the price and risk of a project.

ID ECONOMIC; ARMA
AB Given observations on a stationary economic vector time series process we show that the best h-step ahead forecast (best in the sense of having minimal mean square forecast error) of one of the variables can be consistently estimated by nonparametric regression on an ARMA memory index. Our approach is based on a combination of the ARMA memory index modeling approach of Bierens [7] with a modification to time series of the nonparametric kernel regression approach of Devroye and Wagner [16]. This approach is truly model-free, as no explicit specification of the distribution of the data generating process is needed.

ID GROWTH CURVES; POWER TRANSFORMATIONS; REPEATED MEASUREMENTS; 
   SERIAL COVARIANCE STRUCTURE; TELEPHONE SWITCHING DATA
AB It has been shown in the literature that the data of technological substitutions exhibit a strong correlation across different time periods, that is, a strong serial correlation. Significant improvement in predicting such substitutions has been achieved by incorporating serial correlation and power transformation parameters into four growth curve models. The modified models, or data-based transformed models, however, break down when the number of time points is small. This article proposes a generalized growth curve model for forecasting technological substitutions with concurrent short time series. The model combines the concepts of power transformations and repeated measurements with a common serial covariance structure. Concurrent time series for several cases provide the repeated measurement requirement of the model. Improvement in forecasting accuracy by using this model is demonstrated with a set of telephone switching data.

TI DIAGNOSIS OF UPPER-LEVEL PROCESSES INFLUENCING AN UNUSUALLY INTENSE
   EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONE OVER SOUTHEAST AUSTRALIA
SO WEATHER AND FORECASTING
LA English
DT Article
ID CYCLONE; WEATHER; STORM; TEMPERATURE
AB On 1 December 1987, an unusual midlatitude cyclone affected much of southeastern Australia.  The storm was characterized by unforecasted rapid deepening to a near record low (locally) mean sea-level pressure, high winds, anomalously cold surface temperatures, and near-record low (locally) mean sea-level pressure, high winds, anamalously cold surface temperatures, and near-record rainfall in some areas.  The storm resulted in extensive damage, including a massive livestock kill.  Comparison with storm tracks over southern Australia from the past 20 years shows that the path of this storm was quite unusual for this time of year.Utilizing a series of analyses prepared from an incremental limited area data assimilation system, it is shown that:  1) an amplifying upper-tropospheric wave influenced the initial development and path of the cyclone as it crossed the southern coast of Australia, 2) transverse circulations associated with two juxtaposed upper-level jet streaks embedded in the wave focussed upper-level divergence and midlevel ascent over the low during its rapid intensification phase, and 3) a distinct upper-troposheric isentropic potential vorticity maximum was identified well upstream of the developing low, but with no evidence of an extrusion of this air penetrating and enhancing the low-level circulation as has been found in other cases of rapid cyclogenesis. Given that inadequate operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) guidance was partially to blame for the underforecast of this event, the operational limited area NWP forecasts are presented and compared with forecasts based on the research analyses from the assimilation system.  It is shown that improved forecasts of cyclone intensification and of precipitation result when the model is initialized with the assimilation analyses.  Further improvements are obtained when the grid resolution of the forecast model is increased.  With the operational implementation of the assimilation system into the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) in 1989, the improved guidance resulting from the assimilated analyses is currently available to forecasters in Australia.

TI SENSITIVITY OF 3-DIMENSIONAL TRAJECTORIES TO THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL

SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY

DT Article
ID METEOROLOGICAL; RESOLUTION; CAPTEX; MODELS; SIMULATION
AB Initialization and forecast fields from the National Weather Service's (NWS) Nested Grid Model (NGM) were archived on the 90 km calculational grid at 2-hour intervals out to 12 hours, twice per day, for the 3-month period of January-March 1987.  The resulting time series of meteorological data were used to determine the sensitivity of calculated trajectories to changes in temporal and spatial density of meteorological data during a wide range of synoptic conditions. Trajectories were started from 63 evenly spaced locations, twice per day, for a duration of 4 days each over the 74-day period.  The 9324 separate trajectories were computed using the meteorological data at 90, 180, and 360 km grid spacing and at 2-, 4-, 6-, and 12-hour time intervals.  Calculated trajectories were compared with the base "truth" case of 2-hour data on the 90 km grid.
   Trajectories were most sensitive to changes in temporal resolution when the grid resolution was 90 and 180 km.  Trajectories computed on the coarser 360 km grid had substantially larger deviations from the base case and were no longer sensitive to changes in temporal resolution. Relative horizontal transport deviations ranged from 5-25% of the travel distance at 96 hours depending upon the spatial and temporal resolution. Results suggest that if rawinsonde observations are the primary source of meteorological data (400 km spacing every 12 hours), then the greatest improvement in trajectory accuracy can be achieved by enhancing the temporal frequency of observations to 6-hour intervals. Results were not different when trajectories were categorized by cyclonic or anticyclonic conditions.  However, horizontal deviations during cyclonic conditions were as much as 30% larger than those during anticyclonic conditions.  This was attributed primarily to stronger wind speeds in cyclonic systems.

DT Article
AB A simple one-period-ahead and multiperiod-ahead prediction procedure for multivariate time series is suggested, based on the canonical correlation technique. The prediction procedure is direct in the sense that no lag orders and parameters have to be estimated first, as in the usual ARMAX or VAR parameterizations of multivariate stationary stochastic processes. A best (in the mean squared error sense) predictor can be obtained directly using singular-value decompositions of covariance matrices. The procedure is used to forecast one-year-ahead and multi-year-ahead national growth rates of 14 countries for the years 1974-1984.

   SEASONALITY; TIME SERIES FORECASTING; TRANSFORMATIONS
AB Four options for modeling and forecasting time series data containing increasing seasonal variation are discussed, including data transformations, double seasonal difference models and two kinds of transfer function‐type ARIMA models employing seasonal dummy variables. An explanation is given for the typical ARIMA model identification analysis failing to identify double seasonal difference models for this kind of data. A logical process of selecting one option for a particular case is outlined, focusing on issues of linear versus non‐linear increasing seasonal variation, and the level of stochastic versus deterministic behavior in a time series. Example models for the various options are presented for six time series, with point forecast and interval forecast comparisons. Interval forecasts from data‐transformation models are found to generally be too wide and sometimes illogical in the dependence of their width on the point forecast level. Suspicion that maximum likelihood estimation of ARIMA models leads to excessive indications of unit roots in seasonal moving‐average operators is reported.

AB The results of forecasting experiments based on an error correction mechanism (ECM) model and various types of vector autoregressive (VAR) and Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) models are presented. A Bayesian error correction mechanism (BECM) model is also tested. This model represents a hybrid of the BVAR and ECM models. The results from experiments using fifty industries and monthly Ohio labor market data demonstrate that the ECM model produces forecasts with much lower errors than any of the alternative VAR or BVAR models when the variables used in the model pass the statistical tests for cointegration. The findings confirm many of the beliefs expressed by Granger (1986) and Engle and Yoo (1987) based on theoretical consideration of the ECM model versus the VAR model. A result contradictory to the contentions of Engle and Yoo is that the BECM model performs well at the longer forecast horizons for both cointegrated and non-cointegrated industries.

AB Timber used in the production of lumber in Southwestern Ontario varies in a number of characteristics, and the lump-sum stumpage price is expected to reflect differences in those characteristics.  When heterogeneous inputs are used in production, the hedonic price function approach may be used to estimate marginal implicit values of the various input characteristics.  Hedonic price functions were estimated for timber in Southwestern Ontario using pooled time-series cross-section data from a large sample of timber sales.  The results indicate that volume, species composition, tree size, timber quality and distance to the purchasing mill all affect lump-sum stumpage prices.  Estimates of the contributions that each of these characteristics makes to stumpage prices are presented.  The estimated hedonic model was tested by comparing the model's forecasts of stumpage prices with forecasts made by personnel from the Ministry of Natural Resources.

ID TIME-SERIES MODELS; REGRESSION; COVARIANCE
AB This study proposes that the amount of information about one firm conveyed by management forecasts of another firm in the same industry depends on the earnings covariance between the two firms and the forecast firm's earnings variance. The covariance reflects the competitive relation between the firms and the variance represents noise contained in forecasts. When both variance and covariance are included in regressions, nonforecast firms' abnormal returns are associated with forecast firms' abnormal returns. When they are excluded, no such association is observed. The results are similar, but much weaker, when the independent variable is unexpected management forecasts.

AB Monthly precipitation at 46 stations located throughout the state of Texas was examined over a continuous 62-year period from 1923 to 1984.  Precipitation data were subjected to spectral, empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and correlation analyses.  Focus was on the dominant EOF (E1), which explains 30% to 45% of all precipitation variance.  The time-dependent coefficient associated with E1 closely resembles a statewide average precipitation index.  This time-dependent coefficient undergoes large mouth-to-mouth fluctuations; however, these fluctuations are, for the most part, aperiodic.  Other than slight month-to-month persistence during winter and spring, monthly precipitation anomalies cannot be predicted or anticipated based on time-series or spectral analysis.
   A long-term monthly mean sea level pressure dataset is composited over anomalously wet and anomalously dry months covering the 62 years.  A signal is found in the sea level pressure composites, which is best defined during winter months.  Anomalously wet (dry) months in Texas are associated with a northward (southward) shift of high pressure.
   Simultaneous correlations between monthly statewide precipitation and temperature indicate strong negative (greater than -0.60) correlations during the warm season.  However, lag correlations suggest that precipitation is controlling temperature.  Methods to forecast monthly precipitation in Texas remain elusive.
